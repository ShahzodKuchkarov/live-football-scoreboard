# Live Football World Cup Scoreboard

## Project Overview
This project is a football scoreboard application built using Create React App, TypeScript, Redux, React Testing Library. The app provides real-time score updates for World Cup matches and includes all necessary functional requirements, such as score tracking, match details, and user interface elements.

## Features
- Real-time score updates.
- Match details, including teams, venue, and status.
- UI implementation for displaying current and past matches.
- Test coverage using Jest and Enzyme for testing components and Redux actions/reducers.

## Assumptions
- The application uses static data for the World Cup matches. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced by real-time API calls to fetch match data.
- Redux is used for managing global state (score updates, match data), and this can be expanded to include more features if needed.
- Test coverage is implemented to ensure components and actions work as expected. Further edge cases can be tested in a real-world scenario.

## Notes
- The application is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Since the design is not specified, the UI follows a simple and clean approach to represent the core functionality.
